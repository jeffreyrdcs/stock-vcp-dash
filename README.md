# Stock-vcp-dash

This web-based Dash visualization displays the daily US stock market analysis report compiled by my [stock-vcpscreener](https://github.com/jeffreyrdcs/stock-vcpscreener) repo. Currently the dash app is hosted on https://stock-vcp-dash.herokuapp.com/ and https://jeffreyrdcs.pythonanywhere.com. A scheduled job is run on every weekday at ___ to update the app with the latest report.


## Usage

To run locally:
```
python app.py

The dash app is then available at http://127.0.0.1:8050
